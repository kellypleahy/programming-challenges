# Discussion

I wasn't super excited about doing anything *interesting* for this one, so I just did the quick & dirty solution with
just enough tests to convince myself that things were OK.  If I were going to do this more thoroughly, I'd probably make
a "Step" function for the "VM" that allowed me to single step and have some accessors to read memory and registers
from the tests.  As it stands I did a few simple tests to confirm I thought things were working right, and then called
it a day.
